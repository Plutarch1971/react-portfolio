        My name is Matthew Mendez. I have Canadian equivalent Bachelor's Degree in Education with major Science.
        I worked in the education field for many years. But I always possesed a passion to computer programming.
        So, I had taken many mini computer courses along my work. 
        Finally, I have come across the bootcamp and enrolled myself.
        As part of the course I have already learned a lot of programming languages about web application. 
        They are: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, SQL, Servers and APIs, React, Sequelize and I am excited to learn much more that are coming on the way.
        I am confident that at the end of the bootcamp course, I will have the necessary skills to build
        user-oriented applications.
